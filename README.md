# Membes-app
This script is a job done in the first year of my engineering degree.<br>
The program was written in java and this script is an improved adaptation in python.<br>
The script consists of an application to track members enrolled in a gym. In such an application, the user can add new members, remove members, and display a list of all members.<br>
The script to be executed is the `members_app.py`, while the information of all the members is saved in a csv file `members.csv`.
